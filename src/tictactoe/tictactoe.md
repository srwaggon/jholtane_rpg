Tic-Tac-Toe
---

1. How does Tic-tac-toe work? (Domain)
   1. board
       1. 3x3
   2. players
       1. 2, strictly
       2. each has a symbol, x and o
   3. turns
      1. players take alternating turns inputting their symbol at an open board location
   4. win condition
      1. a win is 3 of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonally.
      2. a tie occurs when the board is filled without a winning player
2. How are we going to build it? (Software)
   1. board
      1. 2d array
      2. visible in some manner
         1. print to console?
   2. players
      1. 
   3. logic
      1. 
   4. input
      1. 

I know I need a board (a visible one to the player)
I know it's to be 3x3 (we have to have 2d array)
I know that there needs to be two players
we have to define two players (player1 and player2)
we have to separate two players (x and O)
we have to check for player's turn ending
after an input, next players turn begins
we have to tell the computer to check inputted information in that array
we also have to check for if certain parts of the array are in line (win condition)
a win is 3 in a row, 3 in a column, 3 diagonally.

----
1. can I create a board that I can track inputs to and read from
2. can I take user input and alternate and update a board (with no game logic)
